 <h3>Kill Bill 2</h3>

 <p>This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have probably watched it a hundred times over the past 15 years, and I will probably watch it another hundred times.  It has all the great elements of a good movie: love, heartbreak, and revenge. </p>


 <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>

 <p>This movie is a classic.  This was my first introduction to the director Quentin Tarantino and it did not fail to intrigue me.  Like Kill Bill 2, it has all the classic elements that make a movie good.  It is long, though.  It came out in 1994, but it is a timeless movie.</p>


 <h3>Jackie Brown</h3>

 <p>If you've read this far, you can see that I am a Quentin Tarantino fan - especially of his 90's movies.  I love this movie because he recreates and improves upon the 70s blaxploitation era with a lovely homage to the original Foxy Brown - Pam Grier.  What makes the movie even better, Pam Grier stars as the main character. She gives sophistication and je ne sais quoi that Foxy Brown lacked. Absolutely one of my favorite movies. I could watch it a thousand times! </p>
